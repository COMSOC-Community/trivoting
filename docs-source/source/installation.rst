Installation
============

Since trivoting are hosted on `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/trivoting/>`_, the
installation should be as easy as:

.. code-block:: shell

    pip3 install trivoting

You can also directly download the sources from our
`GitHub repository <https://github.com/Simon-Rey/trivoting>`_ if that seems easier to you.
