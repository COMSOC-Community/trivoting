Trivoting: Aggregation of Trichotomous Preferences
==================================================

trivoting is a Python library for the aggregation of trichotomous preferences. Trichotomous preferences model situations
in which agents are asked to classify the alternatives in three categories: approved, disapproved and not classified.

In this library, we provide the functionalities to:

- Handle trichotomous preferences,
- link this library with other standard `COMSOC libraries and tools <https://comsoc-community.org/tools>`_,
- Compute the outcome of voting rules on trichotomous preferences.
